# Facebook livestream application auto deal with Kubernetes 
Information technology and Live Commerce (online sales), are gradually being widely used and widely applied to society in general and retail individuals and large enterprises in particular. When the number of sales for each livestream increases, it will be difficult for sellers to close orders as well as manage customer information. So the team wants to create an application that can manage and automatically close live stream orders on Facebook, helping sellers easier and more convenient to manage sales when livestreams. Especially, the team will research and use __Kubernetes__ , one of the open source platforms that helps automate a lot of manual processes related to deployment, management, expansion, ... to be able to deploy and build this app.
